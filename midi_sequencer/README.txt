The MIDI Sequencer Components are a set components to implement MIDI handling by Delphi programs. 

Aim
The aim of the project is to create a package of components such that the developer can add MIDI capabilities to a Delphi Form

Target audience
Delphi developers

Current status
The components are insufficiently foolproof to use separately on the form
As a workaround the component TMIDI_Sequencer has been developed that should cover all the basic sequencing needs.
